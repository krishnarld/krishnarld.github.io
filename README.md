# Postdoctoral researcher, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.

I am a Multidisciplinary Researcher specializing in the intersection of Digital Twin frameworks, AI/ML, and Computational Mechanics. My work focuses on developing ML algorithms for real-time monitoring of physical systems and reducing training cost.

My background includes extensive research into the mechanical abuse characterization of EV batteries, with the goal of engineering advanced safety systems using metamaterials to protect critical energy storage components
