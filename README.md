# Postdoctoral researcher, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.

I am a multidisciplinary Researcher specializing in Digital Twins, Computational Mechanics, Battery Safety analysis, Experimental testing, and AI/ML. My work integrates experimental characterization (quasi-static, high strain-rate, and fatigue/fracture) with numerical analysis to design advanced safety systems for critical energy storage. Also, I develop ML algorithms and Digital Twin frameworks for real-time health monitoring of physical assets.

<ins>**Enhancing EV Battery Safety via Mechanical Testing and Machine Learning**</ins>

In this work, we investigate the crash safety of Li-ion battery modules through a combination of mechanical experiments, high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations, and machine learning. By testing prismatic cells and jellyrolls under various static and dynamic impact conditions, the research identifies critical damage behaviors and the specific energy absorption roles of different structural components. These insights are integrated into an AI-driven design framework to optimize protective sandwich structures, ultimately enhancing the crashworthiness and reliability of electric vehicle battery systems

<ins>**Energy absorption of auxetic metamaterials**</ins>

This research advances the design of additively manufactured auxetic structures, with a focus on enhancing energy absorption and accurately predicting failure modes. Through experimental testing and validated finite element modeling, the study introduces a novel "re-entrant diamond" unit cell that achieves 96% higher specific energy absorption than standard designs. Additionally, the work proposes a high-performance hybrid tube concept and validates a fracture locus model for 3D-printed Al10SiMg, enabling precise prediction of structural deformation under dynamic loads.

<ins>**Derivative-informed ML and its application to digital twin framework**</ins>

Digital twins are modeled to represent the state of any physical system; they should be accurate, rapid, and have the ability to evolve together with the physical twin (Generic schematic of a digital twin is shown Figure 1). In this work, higher-order derivatives were incorporated to obtain an accurate model, but this comes at the expense of an increased dataset size. Additionally, to adapt to a specific physical twin, new data obtained from the physical twin must be incorporated into the model without extensive retraining. We address the computational challenges of large data, enabling real-time, dynamic updates as new in-service information becomes available (through dynamic supernodes in sparse GP, as shown in Figure 2). We validated the method on an aerospace fatigue crack growth; the approach outperforms traditional static methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for continuous structural health monitoring and predictive maintenance.

<ins>**Framework for rapid qualification of additively manufactured parts**</ins>

Qualifying metal additively manufactured (AM) parts is complicated by process-induced microstructural variations that lead to uneven fatigue performance. This work leverages process-structure modeling to estimate location-specific fatigue life across 3D AM domains. By analyzing nonlocal-averaged Fatigue Indicator Parameters (FIPs) over thousands of loading cycles, we determine the cycle count at which critical thresholds are reached, enabling accurate life prediction for complex AM components.
